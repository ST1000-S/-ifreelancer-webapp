#### E2E Tests Results

E2E tests using Playwright were attempted but interrupted due to database seeding issues. The following test areas need to be validated:

- Authentication flow (sign in/sign up)
- Job listing and filtering
- User profile management
- Job application processes
- Dashboard functionality

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Test Configuration Issues**:

   - Jest configuration for ESM imports is causing failures with the auth module tests
   - Database reset and seeding process is not reliable in the test environment

2. **Functional Issues**:

   - Logger is not properly truncating long messages (exceeding expected length)
   - Rate limiter has timing inconsistencies
   - Email service is failing in test environment due to network connectivity

3. **Test Coverage Gaps**:
   - Limited coverage of frontend components
   - Insufficient tests for error states and edge cases
   - Missing integration tests for complex workflows

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Test Configuration**:

   - Update Jest configuration to properly handle ESM imports from `@auth/prisma-adapter`
   - Configure a dedicated test database with reliable seeding and cleanup

2. **Improve Test Coverage**:

   - Add component tests for all major UI components
   - Increase coverage of error handling and edge cases
   - Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows

3. **Address Functional Issues**:

   - Fix logger truncation logic to properly handle messages over 10KB
   - Improve rate limiter to handle timing more consistently in tests
   - Add mock for email service to avoid network dependencies in tests

4. **Test Automation Improvements**:

   - Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions
   - Add automated accessibility testing
   - Implement visual regression testing for UI components

5. **Test Data Management**:
   - Create robust test fixtures for all entities
   - Improve data isolation between tests
   - Implement proper cleanup after tests to avoid state leakage

### Priority Tasks

1. Fix the ESM import issue in the Jest configuration
2. Address the logger truncation bug
3. Implement proper mocking for the email service
4. Complete the E2E test suite for critical user flows
5. Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions

   - Implemented automated tests for core API functionality
   - Added test coverage for authentication, jobs CRUD, and profile endpoints
   - Designed the test script to clean up after itself by deleting test data

### Next Steps for Testing

1. **Fix Jest Configuration**:

   - Update configuration to properly handle ESM imports from Auth modules
   - Improve test isolation to prevent cross-test contamination

2. **E2E Test Improvements**:
